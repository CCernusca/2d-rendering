Rendering 2D Geometry to a 1D-Plane (2D sight simulation)

The simulation has a scene which contains colored geometry objects and viewers, which are cameras that can be moved around the scene and render their view to a separate window.
There is also a main window, which displays all geometry and viewers in a birds-eye view.
